     The JGoodies Binding builds adapter chains between the domain layer
     and the presentation layer and updates both sides:  
        views are updated if domain object properties have been changed, 
        and domain properties are updated if the presentation has been changed. 
        

	 <h2>Related Documentation</h2>
	 
	 You can find a presentation about Binding techniques at the 
	 <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/articles/">JGoodies Articles</a> page.
	 
    <p>
	Currently the primary documentation are the accompanying tutorial sources.
	These demonstrate typical uses of the Binding library. It is strongly 
	recommended to browse and study all tutorial example classes.
 
	 <p>
	 Martin Fowler is in the process of adding 
	 <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/">further patterns</a> 
	 to his catalog of "Patterns for Enterprise Application Architecture" [P of EAA].
	 These additions contain the
	 <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html">Presentation 
	 Model</a> pattern that can significantly improve the architecture
	 and maintainability of your Swing applications.
	 
	 <p>
     An overview of the application architecture around this
     data binding is available at pp. 255 in this
     <a href="http://www.cincom.com/downloads/pdf/AppDevGuide.pdf"
        target="dynamic">Application Guide</a>.
     
     There's an introduction to 
     <a href="http://c2.com/ppr/vmodels.html">ValueModels</a>,
     and you may read the 
     <a href="http://www.object-arts.com/EducationCentre/Overviews/MVC.htm">Comparison</a>
     of our approach with MVP.

	<h3>Domain Layer</h3>
	
	The tutorial is built around the Album class. It provides 'aspects' 
	that we want to present in a UI, and a UI may update 
	the values of these aspects, or we build up a two-way connection 
	between the UI and the aspects and each side can update the other. 
	In other words, the model's aspects are bound to UI components.
 
    <p>
	The aspects can be read-write, read-only, or write-only; 
	typically they are read-write. In addition such an aspect can be 
	observable, i.e. other objects can observe changes of the aspect's value. 
	There are different approaches to implement aspects. 
	
	<p>
	In the Java world there's a well-received standard that many people
	work with: the Java Bean standard. Beans provide everything necessary 
	for accessing and observing aspects - here they are called <i>properties</i>. 
	And it's quite easy to follow the Java Bean naming conventions. 
	Basically you provide a pair of getter and setter methods 
	for each property. And typically you fire a PropertyChangeEvent 
	in the setter to notify observers about property changes.
	The Binding works with other domain object styles, 
	but many convenience classes focus on Beans.
	Also, if you use Beans, you need no references from your domain classes
	to the JGoodies Binding library. This makes it easier to change
	the binding style later.
	
	<p>
	In the tutorial the <tt>Album</tt> class extends <tt>Model</tt>
	and provides getters and setters for each property, for example
	<tt>#getTitle()</tt> and <tt>setTitle(String)</tt>. 
 
 
	<h3>From Domain to ValueModel</h3>
	
	The PresentationModel class vends adapters
	that convert the domain Bean properties into the ValueModel interface.
	For example to access an Album's title we write: 
	new PresentationModel(anAlbum).getModel("title"). 
	We can then read and write the title via the ValueModel methods
	<tt>#getValue</tt>/<tt>#setValue</tt>. 
 
 
	<h3>ValueModel</h3>
	We now can read and write domain aspects using a uniform and 
	very simple API (getValue/setValue) and can observe value changes. 
	We can operate on these values to convert types, to buffer values, 
	to cache values, etc. We can reuse a set of classes for each 
	of these tasks. For example the BufferedValueModel delays 
	value changes until you commit them. Or we can change the value 
	source using a multiplexer, so that we can change the customer 
	instance we're asking for the last name. Think of a JList of 
	albums where you select different albums and a details 
	view shows the title and artist of the current selection 
	in a form with text field.
 
	<h3>From ValueModel to Swing Model</h3>
	To use a ValueModel with a Swing component, we've to convert
	from the #getValue/#setValue interface to the model interface 
	as required by the component class. For example ValueModels 
	that holds Strings can be converted to the Document interface 
	that is the model for JTextComponent. Or a ValueModel that holds 
	a Boolean can be converted to a ToggleButtonModel for use in 
	a JCheckBox or JRadioButton. All these adapters can replace the 
	Swing convenience model implementations. The Binding library 
	provides prepared adapters to Swing components in package 
	<tt>com.jgoodies.binding.adapter</tt>.
 
   <p>
	In some cases we need to set Swing component properties that
	have no underlying model. For example, the <i>value</i> property
	of the JFormattedTextField has no model that stores this value.
	The PropertyConnector class can connect two properties in
	two beans and synchronizes each property value with the other.
 
 
	<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
	This binding approach can be used in many applications - 
	I'd say in about 70 or 80% of all Swing applications. 
	It can significantly save time to bind and buffer domain aspects 
	in a Swing UI. However, the downside is that this approach 
	increases the learning curve that is already quite high in Swing. 
	And so, check carefully whether this binding is appropriate in your project.
 
 	<p>
	Our binding leads to clean code and helps developers understand 
	where to put what code: 1) implement domain aspects in domain 
	Bean classes, 2) build panel classes that consist only of UI 
	components and panel building code, 3) connect these two layers 
	using a chain of adapters or using a middle code layer that 
	holds these adapter so that other views can present the same data. 
 
 	<p>
	A true alternative to this binding is to copy values from 
	the domain object to the convenience models of the Swing 
	components and write the values back to the domain if you click on OK. 
	The copying approach is easy to understand and works well 
	if each aspect is presented by a single view.
	If multiple views present the same value, you may end up 
	with cluttered code.
	<p>
	Anyway, even with the copying approach you can (and should)
	benefit from the Presentation Model pattern and a 3-tier 
	architecture.
