/**
 * Adds binding capabilities for bean property names to its superclass
 * that can bind ValueModels, SelectionInLists, Actions, and
 * ListModel + ListSelectionModel. Note that you can bind properties
 * of the presentation model's bean (#bindBeanProperty) as well as
 * properties of the presentation model itself (#bindProperty).<p>
 *
 * <strong>Examples:</strong>
 * <pre>
 * BeanPropertyBinder binder = Binders.binderFor(aBean);
 * binder.bindBeanProperty("artist")   .to(artistField);
 * binder.bindBeanProperty("title")    .to(titleField);
 * binder.bindBeanProperty("classical").to(classicalBox);
 * binder.bindProperty    ("filtered") .to(filteredBox);
 * </pre>
