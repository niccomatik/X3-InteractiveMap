 * An abstract superclass that minimizes the effort required to provide

 * This class follows the conventions and recommendations as described
 * in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/docs/spec.html"
 * >Java Bean Specification</a>.<p>
 *
 * Uses class {@link com.jgoodies.binding.beans.ExtendedPropertyChangeSupport},
 * to enable the {@code ==} or {@code #equals} test when
 * changing values.<p>

 * TODO: Consider adding a method {@code #fireChange} that invokes
 * {@code #firePropertyChange} if and only if
 * {@code new value != old value}. The background is, that
 * {@code #firePropertyChange} must fire an event
 * if {@code new value==null==old value}.<p>
