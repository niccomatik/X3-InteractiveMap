/**
 * Represents a selection in a list of objects. Provides bound bean properties
 * for the list, the selection, the selection index, and the selection empty
 * state. The SelectionInList implements ValueModel with the selection as value.
 * Selection changes fire an event only if the old and new value are not equal.
 * If you need to compare the identity you can use and observe the selection
 * index instead of the selection or value.<p>
 *
 * The SelectionInList uses three ValueModels to hold the list, the selection
 * and selection index and provides bound bean properties for these models.
 * You can access, observe and replace these ValueModels. This is useful
 * to connect a SelectionInList with other ValueModels; for example you can
 * use the SelectionInList's selection holder as bean channel for a
 * PresentationModel. Since the SelectionInList is a ValueModel, it is often
 * used as bean channel. See the Binding tutorial classes for examples on how
 * to connect a SelectionInList with a PresentationModel.<p>
 *
 * This class also implements the {@link ListModel} interface that allows
 * API users to observe fine grained changes in the structure and contents
 * of the list. Hence instances of this class can be used directly as model of
 * a JList. If you want to use a SelectionInList with a JComboBox or JTable,
 * you can convert the SelectionInList to the associated component model
 * interfaces using the adapter classes
 * {@link com.jgoodies.binding.adapter.ComboBoxAdapter}
 * and {@link com.jgoodies.binding.adapter.AbstractTableAdapter} respectively.
 * These classes are part of the Binding library too.<p>
 *
 * The SelectionInList supports two list types as content of its list holder:
 * {@code List} and {@code ListModel}. The two modes differ in how
 * precise this class can fire events about changes to the content and structure
 * of the list. If you use a List, this class can only report
 * that the list changes completely; this is done by firing
 * a PropertyChangeEvent for the <em>list</em> property.
 * Also, a {@code ListDataEvent} is fired that reports a complete change.
 * In contrast, if you use a ListModel it will report the same
 * PropertyChangeEvent. But fine grained changes in the list
 * model will be fired by this class to notify observes about changes in
 * the content, added and removed elements.<p>
 *
 * If the list content doesn't change at all, or if it always changes
 * completely, you can work well with both List content and ListModel content.
 * But if the list structure or content changes, the ListModel reports more
 * fine grained events to registered ListDataListeners, which in turn allows
 * list views to chooser better user interface gestures: for example, a table
 * with scroll pane may retain the current selection and scroll offset.<p>
 *
 * An example for using a ListModel in a SelectionInList is the asynchronous
 * transport of list elements from a server to a client. Let's say you transport
 * the list elements in portions of 10 elements to improve the application's
 * responsiveness. The user can then select and work with the SelectionInList
 * as soon as the ListModel gets populated. If at a later time more elements
 * are added to the list model, the SelectionInList can retain the selection
 * index (and selection) and will just report a ListDataEvent about
 * the interval added. JList, JTable and JComboBox will then just add
 * the new elements at the end of the list presentation.<p>
 *
 * If you want to combine List operations and the ListModel change reports,
 * you may consider using an implementation that combines these two interfaces,
 * for example {@link com.jgoodies.common.collect.ArrayListModel}
 * or {@link com.jgoodies.common.collect.LinkedListModel}.<p>
 *
 * <strong>Important Note:</strong> If you change the ListModel instance,
 * either by calling {@code #setListModel(ListModel)} or by setting
 * a new value to the underlying list holder, you must ensure that
 * the list holder throws a PropertyChangeEvent whenever the instance changes.
 * This event is used to remove a ListDataListener from the old ListModel
 * instance and is later used to add it to the new ListModel instance.
 * It is easy to violate this constraint, just because Java's standard
 * PropertyChangeSupport helper class that is used by many beans, checks
 * a changed property value via {@code #equals}, not {@code ==}.
 * For example, if you change the SelectionInList's list model from an empty
 * list {@code L1} to another empty list instance {@code L2},
 * the PropertyChangeSupport won't generate a PropertyChangeEvent,
 * and so, the SelectionInList won't know about the change, which
 * may lead to unexpected behavior.<p>
 *
 * This binding library provides some help for firing PropertyChangeEvents
 * if the old ListModel and new ListModel are equal but not the same.
 * Class {@link com.jgoodies.binding.beans.ExtendedPropertyChangeSupport}
 * allows to permanently or individually check the identity (using
 * {@code ==}) instead of checking the equity (using {@code #equals}).
 * Class {@link com.jgoodies.binding.beans.Model} uses this extended
 * property change support. And class {@link ValueHolder} uses it too
 * and can be configured to always test the identity.<p>
 *
 * Since version 1.0.2 this class provides public convenience methods
 * for firing ListDataEvents, see the methods {@code #fireContentsChanged},
 * {@code #fireIntervalAdded}, and {@code #fireIntervalRemoved}.
 * These are automatically invoked if the list holder holds a ListModel
 * that fires these events. If on the other hand the underlying List or
 * ListModel does not fire a required ListDataEvent, you can use these
 * methods to notify presentations about a change. It is recommended
 * to avoid sending duplicate ListDataEvents; hence check if the underlying
 * ListModel fires the necessary events or not. Typically an underlying
 * ListModel will fire the add and remove events; but often it'll lack
 * an event if the (selected) contents has changed. A convenient way to
 * indicate that change is {@code #fireSelectedContentsChanged}. See
 * the tutorial's AlbumManagerModel for an example how to use this feature.<p>
 *
 * The SelectionInList is partially defined for Lists and ListModels
 * that contain {@code null}. Setting the selection to {@code null}
 * on a SelectionInList that contains {@code null} won't set the selection index
 * to the index of the first {@code null} element. For details see the
 * {@link #setSelection(Object)} JavaDocs. This is because the current
 * implementation interprets a {@code null} selection as <em>unspecified</em>,
 * which maps better to a cleared selection than to a concrete selection index.
 * Anyway, as long as you work with the selection index and selection index
 * holder, such a SelectionInList will work fine. This is the case if you bind
 * a SelectionInList to a JList or JTable. Binding such a SelectionInList
 * to a JComboBox won't synchronize the selection index if {@code null}
 * is selected.<p>
 *
 * <strong>Constraints:</strong> The list holder holds instances of {@link List}
 * or {@link ListModel}, the selection holder values of type {@code E}
 * and the selection index holder of type {@code Integer}. The selection
 * index holder must hold non-null index values; however, when firing
 * an index value change event, both the old and new value may be null.
 * If the ListModel changes, the underlying ValueModel must fire
 * a PropertyChangeEvent.
